# StryperBot
A Discord bot made to automate Stryper Saturdays. Stryper Saturdays are when a Stryper song is posted on a Discord server for all to enjoy. However, sometimes someone forgets to post such, so automation is the solution.

"But what if I still want to do it myself?" you say. The answer is that StryperBot is intended to determine whether someone has already enacted Stryper Saturday, and if so, step down. However, if no-one has enacted Stryper Saturday then StryperBot will do so. The exact time the Discord members have till StryperBot posts is undetermined as of yet.

This should be pretty easy to customise too.
